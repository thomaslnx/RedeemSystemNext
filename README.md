- Tailwind CSS;

After make the clone of this repo and enter inside his folder, run the command: <br>
```sh

**OBS:** Is possible the need to be created data inside the container's database for displayng in the application.
     To achieve this you can use the Swagger interface on the backend part. The instructions are in the related
